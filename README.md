# waddington-project

The _Waddington_ or _epigenetic landscape_ provides a theoretical framework for cell development and differentiation.

This project aimso to develop a set of _Julia_ tools to determine the structure of such landscapes for a given dynamical system.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

_TODO_
What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

_TODO_
A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

_TODO_
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

_TODO_
Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

_TODO_
Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
