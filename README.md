# Waddle -- Waddington's epigenetic landscape


<!---This project aims to develop a set of _Julia_ tools and methods to 
explore the structure of such landscapes for a given model. We use single-cell data as well as simulated data. --->

We provide different tools and methods in Julia to <br/>
(1) simulate, explore and analyse the landscape for a given model and <br/>
(2) visualise the landscape of certain genes or gene combinations (after applying dimensionality reduction) given a single-cell data set.

## Motivation

The _Waddington_ or _epigenetic landscape_ provides a theoretical framework for cell development and differentiation. A figure and citation from Waddington's original paper [1]:

![Part of the epigenetic landscape](pres/landscapeCitation.png?raw=true "Part of the epigenetic landscape")

<!--- ![Part of the epigenetic landscape](pres/ball.PNG?raw=true "Part of the epigenetic landscape")

_"The path followed by the ball [â€¦] corresponds to the developmental history of a particular part of the egg.
There is first an alternative, towards the right or the left. Along the former path, a second alternative is offered; along the path to the left, the main channel continues leftwards, but there is an alternative path which, however, can only be reached over a threshold"_ (Waddington, 1940). --->


## Workflow

![Workflow](pres/workflow.png?raw=true "Workflow of the project")

## Mathematical introduction on stochastic models and landscape formation:

The cell development process can be described by a general stochastic model.

How do we get from a stochastic system to an epigenetic landscape?
* Some stochastic systems can be expressed in terms of a potential.
* Potential functions are similar to epigenetic landscapes.

<!--- A general stochastic model is of the form: --->

![A general stochastic model](pres/stochasticModel.png?raw=false)

<!--- and can be written as an ODE  
in the limit of noise (high copy numbers). --->

## Optional input: SBML file

## Stabiltiy analysis

## Different ways to simulate the landscape:

### (1) Probability Flux Method (PFM)

### (2) Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)

### (3) Action-based method (ABM)

## Landscapes from single-cell data

## Dimensionality Reduction (DR)
Different dimensionality reduction methods are used, ia linear methods such as PCA, SVD, PPCA as well as non-linear methods such as Kernel PCA, MDS, ICA.
