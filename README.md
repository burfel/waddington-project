# Waddle -- Waddington's epigenetic landscape

The _Waddington_ or _epigenetic landscape_ provides a theoretical framework for cell development and differentiation.

This project aim to develop a set of _Julia_ tools to explore the structure of such landscapes for a given model. We use single-cell data as well as simulated data.

## Structure

### Simulations
#### Single-cell data
#### GPU
#### Optimisation: MAP

### Stability Analysis

### Dimensionality Reduction
Different dimensionality reduction methods are used, ia linear methods such as PCA, SVD, PPCA as well as non-linear methods such as kernelPCA, MDS, ICA and tSNE.
